This is a code implementing a Hybrid-Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for
the 2 dimensional Schwinger model with N_f=2 fermions. 

Originally it is based on a code developed by Nils Christian, wich
Pavel Buividovic and Carsten Urbach have simplyfied and adopted for a
summer school in Dubna, Russia. 

dalbandea fork: added CPU parallelization with OpenMP in `qed-openmp`,
to use with `no_timescales = 1`.
